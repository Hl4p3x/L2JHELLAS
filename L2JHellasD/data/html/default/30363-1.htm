It is only natural that in order to create a duel<br1>
sword, you'd need the two single swords which<br1>
being combined.<br1>
<br>
Of course, I charge a small fee since I'm not<br1>
working for charity and all. And heating costs<br1>
for stoking the fire are pretty steep...<br1>
<br>
As you may know, it is not easy to handle the<br1>
sword unless the balance between both hands<br1>
is equal.
<br>
That means that only swords of identical<br1>
grades can be combined...<br1>
<br>
Plus, keep in mind that enchanted weapons<br1>
lose their effect once they are combined with<br1>
another sword.<br1>
<br>
My, am I worrying for nothing? Well, I'm sure<br1>
you know all this.<br1>
<br>
Here, select the sword that you wish to<br1>
combine from the following list.<br1>
